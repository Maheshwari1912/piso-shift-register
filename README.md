**Aim of Parallel-In Serial-Out (PISO) Shift Register:**

The PISO shift register aims to convert parallel data inputs into a serial data stream. 

This is useful when you need to transfer or transmit multiple data bits sequentially over a single communication line or channel, thereby saving the number of required physical connections.
